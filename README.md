TicTacToe : 

https://moshiko1988.github.io/TicTacToe/

I used SPA to make the game smooth
javascript - logic and functions of the game.
bootstrap - buttons and nav bar.
Jquary - To make the user experience easier
        when you open the URL you must create/loging to your account in order to play.
        the new game buttons will immediately show up and a user can create a new game and
        check how many games they played.

Process:

I started the project with creating a sinple html and css files.
on my first day of the project i got lost and couldnt figure out where to start building my code
on the second day i decided to break down evey problem i had and list all the things that need to  be done.
i started with building the logics for the game and the turn switch, then i proceed with some jquery click handlers. i got most of my game done by the second day of the project. on the third day i got stuck with the API/AJAX files and i had to reseach how to write a working code for it.
finally on the fourth day of the project i manage to make everything works and started to design the page, nav bar and the buttons.

unsolved problems:
* when a user click on the same box twice i made a log saying "pick a different spot" but after the user kept on playing the log would only hide after a user win/los/draw.
* i wanted to create a user history log that will be open to everyone to see who loged to the game and when by list.

user history created before making the game:

*i want the game to look as easy to use.
*i want to make the user experience very simple .
*i want to have a history list of who played.
